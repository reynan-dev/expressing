# Help us to make this project big.

Our project is open source, so you can help us to make it better. 

The main idea is to create a framework that can be used by anyone, so we need to make it easy to use and to understand.

We have a [trello, join us!](https://trello.com/b/H1X0oyol/expressing).

## Start contributing

The most effective way to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues. You can also contribute by sending pull requests of features or bug fixes to us.

To send a pull request, you need to fork the repository, make changes in your forked repository and then send a pull request. if you dont know how to fork a repository, you can read this [article](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).

To understand how to make a pull request, you can follow the steps below or read the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

- Navigate to the original repository where you created your fork.
- Above the list of files, click `Pull request`.
- On the `Compare page`, click compare across forks.
- In the `"base branch"` drop-down menu, select the branch of the upstream repository you'd like to merge changes into.
- In the `"head fork"` drop-down menu, select your fork, then use the "compare branch" drop-down menu to select the branch you made your changes in.
- Type a title`(the title must follow the commit conventions of the project)` and description`(your description must be clear and describe how and what you implement)` for your pull request.
- On user-owned forks, if you want to allow anyone with push access to the upstream repository to make changes to your pull request, select `Allow edits from maintainers`.
- To create a pull request that is ready for review, click `Create Pull Request`. 
- `Wait` for the pull request to be reviewed and merged.
- Done! üéâ

## Commit Conventions. 

Here, we use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. 

On this style: `type (scope) : description`

To turn it much fun and cool, we use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/), so you can use it on your commits to replace type.
